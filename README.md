DEVELOPMENT OF TEST CORPUS WITH LARGE VOCABULARY FOR TURKISH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND A NEW TEST PROCEDURE

Abstract
The most fundamental problem in the automatic speech recognition systems is not the development of a domainspecific automatic speech recognition system, but the development of an automatic speech recognition system with a large vocabulary. Developed automatic speech recognition systems should be tested with a large vocabulary test dataset. For this reason, an automatic speech recognition test corpus was prepared within the scope of the study. Prepared automatic speech recognition test corpus includes conversations from 20 different areas and text files of these conversations. The test procedure presented in the study was also tested on Turkish automatic speech recognition systems with a large vocabulary. It has been observed that the word error rate results ranged between 14-21%. The test corpus and test procedure with a large vocabulary prepared are guiding for the success of automatic speech recognition systems in future studies to be revealed more clearly.
